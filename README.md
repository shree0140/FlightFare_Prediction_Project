# PROJECT:  Flight Fare Prediction Model.

## Overview:
This repository contains the materials and code for a project focused on deploying a machine learning model using Flask. The project aims to predict flight prices and covers key aspects such as interpreting learning curves, evaluating and selecting models, building a web application with the Flask framework, and deploying the application on Render.

## Project Details:

### Learning Curves and Model Evaluation:
- **Understanding Learning Curves:** Explored how learning curves can help to identify underfitting and overfitting in models.
- **Model Selection:** Used learning curves to evaluate various models and select the best-performing model for our flight fare prediction task.

### Web Application Development:
- **Flask:** Built a web application using the Flask framework.
- **WTForms:** Integrated WTForms for handling web forms and input validation.
- **HTML Templates:** Utilized HTML templates with Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Template Inheritance:** Applied template inheritance to create reusable and maintainable templates.

### API Serving and Deployment:
- **Model Serving:** The trained machine learning model was served as an API using Flask.
- **Deployment:** The final Flask application was deployed using Render, making the web app accessible online.
